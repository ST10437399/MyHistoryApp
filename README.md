1.PURPOSE
The purpose of this app is to initially get information on certain history people, know at what age they died at and what were they known of/for whilst they were still alive and what role did, they play.
People who will be using the app are people who are desperate or kneeing to know more about history.it is actually people who are 100% into history.
It is Because of their metabolism kneeing to know more about history whereas it helps them understand people and societies, gives out more information about how people behaved. Knowledge of the past offers new perspectives about the present and give them deeper insight into our lives and lives of others. With lessons from the past, they don’t only learn about death and how they became what they are but also develops ability to intelligence.


2.DESIGN CONSIDERATION

 




INTUITIVE DESIGN
 My design is easy to navigate and use, where it includes a Back button and Enter button and they work perfectly. You also find a Historical design right at the top and should able to see the Name of the App Underneath the picture displayed there’s  also a space provided to enter valid Age, if enter an incorrect age it will display “Sorry, age not matched ….”
  
CONTENT PRIOTISATION
The Functionalities the user needs are displayed, the user can interact with the content that is accordingly displayed.
The information that is Stored and displayed functions intently with the app.

LEGIBLE TEXT CONTENT
 I therefore chose normal font because of less texts and it is used to display meaningful data/information.
 Text size is large enough to see. White text is used throughout the buttons of the app whereas it prompts the user to enter ones input.

MAKE INTERFACE ELEMENTS CLEARLY VISIBLE 
 The user can see all components clearly, there’s enough spacing between each and every variable displayed.
 The app is not confusing at all its easy to use throughout when entering proper and valid information.

HAND POSITION CONTROLS
Only two buttons are displayed which include white text in it and the buttons are fully functional with no error.

IMAGES
I chose the images because they are clear enough whereas the user be prompt to enter age it will therefore appear well with the picture and It blends well with the persons personal information.


 

I Chose this picture as my profile for the app or rather as my background picture because of how they blended the compass and the map all together, it therefore gives Historical views.


 
Space where the user be prompted to enter age and control button to reveal the informations
